# Consulting Services


??? warning "I'm currently at capacity until the end of April 2025"

    If you'd like to work with me, please [request a consultation](https://form.typeform.com/to/gqgTx3I6) or book a [call](./expert-calls.md).

Imagine two businesses, both have incredible founders and innovators. Both with great investors, and an incredible team of engineers.

But a year down the road, while they might be very alike, there is a big difference.

**One is still trying to ship its prototype to production. The other is raising their next round to invest in scaling their product.**

## What's the difference?

After consulting with over a dozen companies and investing in a few, it's not a matter of wanting to succeed.

The difference is in how each company navigates the journey of probabilistic software from prototypes to production. It's a complex task:

- **Systems** they build, in code and best practices chosen as a team
- **Experiments** they prioritize, and ones they cut early
- How they **manage what they can measure**

With ever-improving models, technology fundamentally changes how products are built. You often cannot choose what science can do.

The switch from deterministic to probabilistic software hasn't been easy.

## My background is not like many others

I developed most of my skills at Stitchfix over the past 8 years. I mostly trained models, built production systems, and worked with data.

The mandate when I joined in 2016 was simply '*vision models work now, how do we make money, how do we get to product*'. I managed data labeling teams. I trained vision models to explore generative models and multi-modal embeddings. (This was to improve product search and relevance.)

Sound familiar?

- *Text works now, how do we make money?*
- *How do we do search?* 
- *How do we understand relevance?*
- *How do we build a system that can improve over time using user feedback?*

I'm not a researcher stuck on shiny models. Instead, I'll guide you towards practical solutions. 

- Create simple baselines
- Focus on simple systems
- Prioritize business outcomes

These principles ensure that your AI initiatives remain grounded in real-world applications and deliver tangible results.

And over the past two years I've worked with a dozen companies to help them navigate the landscape. **I know what works and what doesn't.** For everything else, I have a network of trusted experts and vendors to help us.

You might wonder why I don't start my own company. Sadly, a [hand injury](./writing/posts/hand-injury.md) limits how much I can code. Because of this, I want my coding time to have the biggest impact possible. That's why I mainly focus on [instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com) and [education](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md).

## An investment in regret minimization

I've seen companies waste months and millions.

I can't promise you'll succeed or find product-market fit if you work together, but I can promise that I can help you make a clear plan, push your team to keep trying simple experiments, and focus on what really matters.

My job is simple: to tell you when what you think is easy is actually hard, and when what you think is hard is actually easy.

Success is about minimizing regret.

## What people are saying

### [Christian](https://twitter.com/cblovescode), Founder at Dunbar
Can attest that you've been tremendously helpful for the team at Dunbar, the value has gone beyond acceleration of our product too - best way I describe it is full-stack AI-business guidance in a box.

### [Taylor](https://twitter.com/tayhalliday), Head of Product at Zapier
Jason helped us accelerate our RAG offering at Zapier in so many ways. He's a pro if you're looking for someone to come in and give your AI product some added horsepower.

### [Avthar](https://twitter.com/avthars), Lead PM at Timescale
I highly recommend working with Jason. He's brought a wealth of experience and developer understanding to our team, helping us develop better ideas and move faster. 100% worth it.

### [Vitor](https://twitter.com/vitorbal), Staff Software Engineer at Zapier
Highly recommend reaching out to Jason if you want to level up your AI product and team! I always came out of our conversations with insights and ideas to make Zapier Central better.

### [Luke](https://twitter.com/lukeigel), CEO of Kino AI
Definitely speak with Jason if you're doing RAG, semantic search, etc. Amazingly helpful.

## How best to work with me

There are three ways to work with me:

1. **Subscription model**: Includes a 45-minute meeting each week, unlimited email/slack access, and my network of experts. I'll pay to help you with them.

2. **Project-based engagement**: We will tackle a specific initiative with a fixed scope and budget. This includes helping you write content, do research, and anything else you need.

3. **Traditional consulting relationship**: We meet every week to discuss strategy, planning, and execution. I may bring in extra staff.

I don't work on hourly rates, and my work is guaranteed. With the work that we're doing together, **I'm always happy to refund any fees.**

### Minimum Level of Engagement

If these are too much, I suggest reading my [blog](./writing/index.md) or check out my [course on improving RAG systems](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md) which is a fraction of the cost.

- **Async Support**: $9,500 per month, 45 minute weekly syncs and unlimited email/slack access.
- **Strategic Consulting**: Starts at $50k for the entire engagement
- **Comprehensive Consulting**: Starts at $120k for the entire engagement

For services beyond async support, I ask for at least a 3-month commitment. You can pay through Stripe, and my assistant will contact you after. Or, you can fill out our form, and we'll reach out to you. Right now, I'm fully booked until the end of April 2025.
