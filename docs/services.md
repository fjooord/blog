# Consulting Services

??? warning "I'm currently at capacity until the end of April 2025"

    If you'd like to work with me, please [request a consultation](https://form.typeform.com/to/gqgTx3I6) or book a [call](./expert-calls.md).

Imagine two businesses, both have incredible founders and innovators. Both with great investors, and an incredible team of engineers.

But a year down the road, while they might be very alike, there is a big difference.

One is still trying to scale its demo prototype to production. The other is raising funds after deploying a revenue-generating AI system.

## What's the difference?

After consulting with over a dozen companies and investing in a few, it's not a matter of wanting to succeed.

The difference is in how each company navigates the journey of probabilistic software from prototypes to production. It's a complex task:

- Systems they build, in code and best practices chosen as a team
- Experiments they prioritize, and ones they cut early
- How they manage what they can measure

With ever-improving models, technology fundamentally changes how products are built. You often cannot choose what science can do.

The switch from deterministic to probabilistic software hasn't been easy.

## My background is not like many others

I developed most of my skills at Stitchfix over the past 8 years. I mostly trained models, built production systems, and worked with data.

The mandate when I joined was simply 'vision models work now, how do we make money, how do we get to product'. I managed data labeling teams. I trained vision fine-tunes for generative models and multi-modal embeddings. This was to improve product search and relevance.

Sound familiar?

- Text work now, how do we make money?
- How do we do search? 
- How do we understand relevance?
- How do we build a system that can improve over time using user feedback?

I'm not a researcher stuck on shiny models. Instead, I'll guide you towards practical solutions. My approach emphasizes having simple baselines, focusing on straightforward systems, and prioritizing business outcomes. These principles ensure that your AI initiatives remain grounded in real-world applications and deliver tangible results.

And over the past two years I've worked with a dozen companies to help them navigate the landscape. I know what works and what doesn't. For everything else, I have a network of trusted experts and vendors to help you.

You might wonder why I don't start my own company. Sadly, a [hand injury](./writing/posts/hand-injury.md) limits how much I can code. Because of this, I want my coding time to have the biggest impact possible. That's why I mainly focus on [instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com) and [education](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md).

## An investment in regret minimization

I can't promise you'll succeed or find product-market fit if we work together. But I can help. I can make a clear plan. I can push your team to keep things simple and try new ideas. I can help you focus on what really matters.

I've seen companies waste time and money.

My job is simple: to help you see what's easy, what's hard, and how to avoid big mistakes.

## How best to work with me

There are three ways to work with me:

1. It's a subscription model. It includes a 45-minute meeting each week, unlimited email/slack access, and my network of experts. I'll pay to help you with them.

2. Other  is a project-based engagement. We will tackle a specific initiative with a fixed scope and budget. This includes helping you write content, do research, and anything else you need.

3. The third is a traditional consulting relationship. We meet every week to discuss strategy, planning, and execution. I may bring in extra staff.

I don't work on hourly rates, and my work is guaranteed. With the work that we're doing together, I'm always happy to refund any fees.

### Minimum Level of Engagement

If these are too much, I suggest reading my [blog](./writing/index.md) or check out my [course on improving RAG systems](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md) which is a fraction of the cost.

- __Async Support__: $9,500 per month, 45 minute weekly syncs and unlimited email/slack access.
- __Strategic Consulting__: Starts at $50k for the entire engagement
- __Comprehensive Consulting__: Starts at $120k for the entire engagement

For services beyond async support, I ask for at least a 3-month commitment. You can pay through Stripe, and my assistant will contact you after. Or, you can fill out our form, and we'll reach out to you. Right now, I'm fully booked until the end of April 2025.
