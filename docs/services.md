# Independent Advisor

In the past few years, LLMs have taken over. Companies are investing in tools and infrastructure. Everyone is trying to find the best way to use language models for profit.

But now, imagine two businesses, both have incredible founders and innovators. Both with great investors, and an incredible team of engineers.

But a year down the road, while they might be very alike, there is a big difference.

One is still trying to scale its demo prototype to production. The other is raising funds after deploying a revenue-generating AI system.

What's the difference?

I have worked with over a dozen clients. I realized that it's not a matter of wanting to succeed. 

The difference is in how each company navigates the journey of probabilistic software from prototypes to production. It's a complex task. 

- It is the systems they build, in code and the best practices they choose as a team

- It is the experiments they choose to prioritize, and these ones they cut early

- It is how they are able to manage what they can measure.

With these ever-improving models, technology does not build the business. It fundamentally changes how the product is built. You often cannot choose what science can do.

Between waitlist, demos, and 'early alpha's. The switch from deterministic to probabilistic software has not been easy for everyone.

## My background is not like many others

I developed most of my skills at Stitchfix over the past 8 years. I mostly trained models, built production systems, and worked with data.

The mandate when I joined was simply 'vision models work now, how do we make money, how do we get to product'. I managed data labeling teams. I trained vision fine-tunes for generative models and multi-modal embeddings. This was to improve product search and relevance.

Sound familiar?

- Text Models work now, how do we make money?

- How do we do search? 

- How do we understand relevance?

- And more importantly, how do we build a system that can improve over time using user feedback?

I have been working with stochastic systems for a long time. I focus on experimenting and exploring what is possible with AI. And I am not just another researcher hoping to get paid to play with shiny new models.

I will tell you to:

1. Have simple baselines

2. Focus on simple systems

3. Focus on business outcomes

The only difference is that we're working with text instead of pixels.

History does not repeat, but it often rhymes.

And over the past two years I've worked with a dozen companies to help them navigate the landscape. I know what works and what doesn't. For everything else, I have a network of trusted experts and vendors to help you.

## Why don't I start my own company?

Unfortunately, a [hand injury](./writing/posts/hand-injury.md) limits my coding time. So, I want my code to have the highest leverage possible.

## An investment in regret minimization

I cannot promise that you will succeed or find product-market fit if you work with me. I can help you. I can create a solid roadmap. I can push your team to stay simple and run experiments. I can help you think about the right problems. 

I have seen companies burn months and millions.

My job, simply put, is to help you figure out what is easy, what is hard, and to minimize regret.

## How best to work with me

There are three ways to work with me:

1. It's a subscription model. It includes a 45-minute meeting each week, unlimited email/slack access, and my network of experts. I'll pay to help you with them.

2. Other  is a project-based engagement. We will tackle a specific initiative with a fixed scope and budget. This includes helping you write content, do research, and anything else you need.

3. The third is a traditional consulting relationship. We meet every week to discuss strategy, planning, and execution. I may bring in extra staff.

I don't work on hourly rates, and my work is guaranteed. With the work that we're doing together, I'm always happy to refund any fees.
