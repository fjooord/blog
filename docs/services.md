## Are you facing these challenges?

- **Data Flywheel Inefficiencies**: Your AI systems lack robust feedback loops, resulting in stagnant performance.
- **AI Integration Complexities**: Your team struggles to seamlessly incorporate AI into existing workflows and products.
- **Evaluation and Fine-tuning Uncertainties**: Difficulty in assessing AI model performance or optimizing for specific use cases.
- **AI Scalability Hurdles**: Challenges in growing AI initiatives while maintaining quality and business alignment.

## Imagine if...

- You had a proven framework for data flywheels that continuously improve your AI systems' performance.
- Your team seamlessly integrated AI technologies, enhancing existing workflows without disruption.
- You could confidently evaluate and fine-tune AI models, optimized for your specific business needs.
- You possessed strategies to scale AI initiatives, maintaining quality and aligning with your business goals.

## How I can help

With 8 years of experience at Stitchfix, Meta, and NYU, I specialize in:

- Designing self-improving AI systems with robust feedback loops, creating valuable data flywheels.
- Developing and implementing Vision/Text based search systems that integrate seamlessly into existing product ecosystems.
- Crafting comprehensive evaluation frameworks and fine-tuning algorithms for search and recommendation systems.
- Making strategic AI research bets and evaluating vendors to drive innovation and scalable growth.

I've worked with companies that have raised money from top VC firms like [Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com/), [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), [Bessemer Venture Partners](https://www.bvp.com/), [Accel](https://www.accel.com/), [Benchmark](https://www.benchmark.com/), [Coatue Management](https://www.coatue.com/), [Insight Partners](https://www.insightpartners.com/), [Redpoint Ventures](https://www.redpoint.com/), and the [OpenAI Startup Fund](https://openai.com/fund/).

The only real difference between my past work and what we're doing now with language models and RAG? One deals with JPEGs, the other with text files. It's all datasets, labels, and mechanisms to collect feedback to improve the models. Models that unlock economic value for your business.
