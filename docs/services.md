# Independent Advisor

In the past few years, LLMs have taken over. Companies are investing in tools and infrastructure, and everyone is trying to figure out how best to leverage language models for economic value.

But now, imagine two businesses, both have incredible founders and innovators. Both with great investors, and an incredible team of engineers.

But a year down the road, while they might be very alike, there is a big difference.

One is still struggling to scale their prototype from demo into production, while the other was successfully raising another round, deploying a production-ready AI system that is generating revenue.

**What's the difference?**

You see, having worked with over a dozen clients, I realized that it isn't that one wants to succeed and the other does not. 

The difference lies in how each company navigates the complex journey of probabilistic software from prototypes to production. 

- It is the systems they build, in code and the best practices they choose as a team
- It is the experiments they choose to prioritize, and these ones they cut early
- It is how they are able to manage what they can measure.

When building on these models that are constantly improving, technology is not what builds the business. It fundamentally changes how the product is built. You often cannot choose what science can do.

Between waitlist, demos, and 'early alpha's. The transition from deterministic software to probabilistic software has not been easy and smooth for everyone.

## My background is not like many others

I developed most of my skills at Stitchfix over the past 8 years, mostly training models, building production systems, and working with data.

The mandate when I joined was simply 'vision models work now, how do we make money, how do we get to product'. I managed data labeling teams, trained vision fine-tunes, for both generative models and multi-modal embeddings to understand product search and relevance.

Sound familiar?

- Text Models work now, how do we make money?
- How do we do search? 
- How do we understand relevance?
- And more importantly, how do we build a system that can improve over time using user feedback?

I have been building with stochastic systems, focusing on experimentation, and exploring what is possible with AI for a long time. And I am not just another researcher hoping to get paid to play with shiny new models.

I will tell you to:
1. Have simple baselines
2. Focus on simple systems
3. Focus on business outcomes

The only difference is that we're working with text instead of pixels.

History does not repeat, but it often rhymes.

And over the past two years I've worked with a dozen companies to help them navigate the landscape. I've seen what works, and what doesn't, and for everything else, I have a network of trusted experts and battle-tested vendors to help you out.

## Why don't I start my own company?

Unfortunately, due to a [hand injury](./writing/posts/hand-injury.md), I am unable to code as much as I used to, so I want to make sure the code I do has the highest leverage possible.

## An investment in regret minimization

I cannot promise that you will achieve product-market fit or instantly succeed if you work with me. But I can help you create a sound roadmap, push your team to stay simple and run experiments, and ultimately help you think about the right problems. 

I have seen companies burn months and millions.

My job, simply put, is to help you figure out what is easy, what is hard, and to minimize regret.

## How best to work with me

There are three ways to work with me:

1. One is on a subscription-based model with a recurring 45 minute meeting and unlimited email/slack access and access to my network of experts and vendors which I will pay myself to help you out.
2. Other other is a project-based engagement where we tackle a specific initiative with a fixed scope and budget, including helping you write content, do research, and anything else that you need.
3. The third is a more traditional consulting relationship where we meet regularly to discuss strategy, planning, and execution and I potentially bring in additional staff.

I don't work on hourly rates, and my work is guaranteed. With the work that we're doing together, I'm always happy to refund any fees.
