# Systematically Improve Your RAG Applications

[![Top 10 Course on Maven](writing/posts/img/rag-playbook-course.png)](https://maven.com/applied-llms/rag-playbook)

Elevate your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with our intensive, industry-leading course launching February 2024. This program has students from leading tech companies including Amazon, Adobe, Zapier, Meta, Intuit, Shopify, Neo4j, Cisco, as well as numerous independent AI consultants.

Our approach decomposes your system into its core components, identifying bottlenecks and guiding you through focused experiments to enhance your system's performance end to end. We transcend vague directives like "just make it better," offering tangible, step-by-step instructions on how to effectively analyze and leverage your data. 

Learn what it means to 'look at your data' and how to use it to build better products.

??? note "How to get reimbursed"

    Hey {manager},

    There's a course called Systematically Improving RAG Applications that I'd love to enroll in. It's a live, online course with peers who are in similar roles to me, and it's run on Maven, where 40,000+ professionals from companies like Meta, Google, Airbnb, and NASA go to level up when they need to learn quickly and efficiently.

    A few highlights:

    Direct access to Jason Liu and Dan Becker, the expert instructors teaching the course
    Hands-on working sessions to test new tactics and ideas
    Latest thinking in the space on how to solve problems we're facing

    I anticipate being able to put my learnings directly into practice during the course. After the course, I can share the learnings with the team so our entire team levels up.

    The course costs $1,650. If you like, you can review course details here, including the instructorâ€™s bio: https://maven.com/applied-llms/rag-playbook

    What do you think?

    Thanks,
    {Your Name}

    P.S. Other teams have sent a few people to the course together because it's an efficient way to get shared context that otherwise takes back-and-forth time to build. It might make sense for us to send a few folks to this course.


## Course Overview

Build strong fundamentals in building searching systems and improve your RAG systems. I've refined these over 8 years of machine learning engineering and AI consulting. This course will equip you with the skills to:

- Build robust processes for identifying system bottlenecks
- Significantly enhance your probabilistic systems
- Implement advanced RAG techniques for real-world applications

Don't miss this opportunity to transform your RAG capabilities and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving field of applied AI.
