??? note "How to get reimbursed"

    Hey {manager},

    There's a course called Systematically Improving RAG Applications that I'd love to enroll in. It's a live, online course with peers who are in similar roles to me, and it's run on Maven, where 40,000+ professionals from companies like Meta, Google, Airbnb, and NASA go to level up when they need to learn quickly and efficiently.

    A few highlights:

    Direct access to Jason Liu and Dan Becker, the expert instructors teaching the course
    Hands-on working sessions to test new tactics and ideas
    Latest thinking in the space on how to solve problems we're facing

    I anticipate being able to put my learnings directly into practice during the course. After the course, I can share the learnings with the team so our entire team levels up.

    The course costs $1,650. If you like, you can review course details here, including the instructorâ€™s bio: https://maven.com/applied-llms/rag-playbook

    What do you think?

    Thanks,
    {Your Name}

    P.S. Other teams have sent a few people to the course together because it's an efficient way to get shared context that otherwise takes back-and-forth time to build. It might make sense for us to send a few folks to this course.
