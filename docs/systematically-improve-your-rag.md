## What are people saying?

### Max (Software Engineer, Launch School)
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This course was exactly what I was looking for, as an engineer building a production RAG system. I took away practical lessons from every lecture that I could go back and implement in my own work. More than that, interacting with the other students and guest speakers felt like I was learning from a community on the vanguard of this emerging field. A lot of the best practices in this field are still unpublished (or buried in technical papers). This course was a head start on what I suspect will be established conventions in a few years.

### Christopher (Senior Data/AI Architect, Procurement Sciences AI)
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This course does an excellent job of stressing the fundamentals while providing useful metric tools to measure the current state of your RAG system and then show concrete improvement. The teachers have a deep background in RAG and recommendation system. The guest speakers are professionals working at the edges of RAG technologies and share their insights and journey. The peer group is also fantastic and built from peers also working in the field on actual RAG implementations.

### Vitor (Staff Software Engineer, Zapier)
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Anyone can ship a shiny RAG demo, but evolving it into something actually useful and accurate is a whole different story-- Jason and Dan help set you on the right path with this course that's jam-packed with content, insights, and practical lessons from their experience working with industry leaders. I especially enjoyed the emphasis on looking at your data and building a flywheel that's grounded on evaluations and metrics, and not "vibes"-based AI engineering. If you want to get serious about building RAG systems, this course can save you months of trial and error. Highly recommended!

### Moose (Founder & CEO, Sociail, Inc.)
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Wow, this six-week online course on Improving RAG was a game-changer! I had an absolute blast learning alongside more than 100 fellow coursemates, all bringing different levels of experience to the table. The guest lectures were a real treat, adding some serious firepower to our learning. But here's the real kicker — despite our varied backgrounds, Jason and Dan somehow managed to create a solid baseline for everyone. They've got this knack for breaking down complex RAG concepts into a framework that just clicks, no matter where you're starting from. I walked away with great validation and practical ideas we could apply to our production RAG implementation right away in our startup, which is precisely what I was hoping for. The course delivered great value, striking that perfect balance between theory and real-world application. It's pretty amazing how they pulled it off, considering they only had six weeks and how quickly the RAG field is evolving. Kudos to Jason, Dan, and the whole team for putting together such an incredible learning experience!

??? note "How to get reimbursed"

    Hey {manager},

    There's a course called Systematically Improving RAG Applications that I'd love to enroll in. It's a live, online course with peers who are in similar roles to me, and it's run on Maven, where 40,000+ professionals from companies like Meta, Google, Airbnb, and NASA go to level up when they need to learn quickly and efficiently.

    A few highlights:

    Direct access to Jason Liu and Dan Becker, the expert instructors teaching the course
    Hands-on working sessions to test new tactics and ideas
    Latest thinking in the space on how to solve problems we're facing

    I anticipate being able to put my learnings directly into practice during the course. After the course, I can share the learnings with the team so our entire team levels up.

    The course costs $1,650. If you like, you can review course details here, including the instructor’s bio: https://maven.com/applied-llms/rag-playbook

    What do you think?

    Thanks,
    {Your Name}

    P.S. Other teams have sent a few people to the course together because it's an efficient way to get shared context that otherwise takes back-and-forth time to build. It might make sense for us to send a few folks to this course.
