I'm learning and taking on new roles. Right now, I'm focusing more on marketing and copywriting rather than technical details.
First and foremost, I'm learning how to be a manager and specifically delegate more work to my team so I can focus on the high-leverage work possible

## What I value most

- **Constant learning and growth**: I'm driven by the need to learn continuously. I expect the same from my team—always pushing forward.
- **Move fast and break things**: Ex-Meta. Execute fast. If you're wrong, we can fix it later. Just don't wait around for approval, nothing we do is too big to fail.
- **Give me time freedom with asynchronous communication**: I prefer async, if you message me assume I only have 5 minutes to process and respond, if it takes longer, I might lose the opportunity.
- **Be direct in communication**: When you need an answer, keep it yes/no or number-based. Be brief, and don't bury important information.
- **Health first, minimize typing**: I have had a hand injury for 4 years, it takes away from my health when I have to type for long periods of time. I prefer face-to-face time or video feedback instead of typing.
- **Take ownership and ask for clarity**: If the task is hard, I probably didn't give enough details, assume everything is Jason's fault, ask me for what you need — I won't take it personally.
- **Simplicity is key**: I really hate complexity that people have not earned. If I see a flowchart with like 12 things in it, I usually just lose my mind.

## Understand my pet peeves

I'm super anxious, my brain runs on 100 timers and checklists. My success in managing multiple responsibilities—including teaching 2 courses with 200 students, maintaining an active social media presence, writing 5 blog posts monthly, maintaining an open-source library, and consulting for 5 clients simultaneously—stems from my reliance on mental timers and checklists. This system helps me context switch and cache information, but it also means I need regular updates to manage my anxiety and maintain a clear picture of where everything stands.

- **I hate silence**: Not getting updates makes me anxious, 'working on this', 'this is done', 'i'm blocked here' are all good messages to send me. I'll get better I promise, but for now, I like frequent updates.
- **Context switching messes with my flow**: I change contexts constantly, so remind me where things are when you update me, assume i read but don't remember thel ink you sent me 3 days ago.
- **Lack of feedback stalls growth**: I need critical feedback regularly. If you're not telling me what could be better, it's holding both of us back.

## How to communicate with me

- **Always use asynchronous first**: Slack or text messages work best for me. Keep it brief—use bullet points over long explanations.
- **I'm often working on the go**: Messages should be structured for quick skimming since I'm often on my phone or Apple Watch. Put the key info at the top.
- **Ask only specific questions**: When asking for decisions, try to frame questions so they can be answered with yes/no or numbers. Consider "how can i help?" or "what do you need?" vs "do you think i should work on x?".
- **Prep me for meetings and follow up afterward**: Send me the materials I need before meetings to help reset my focus. Afterward, follow up with a summary and action items.

## How I prioritize work and delegate

- **Client work always comes first**: Client tasks are the top priority. We should always be in the process of moving things along or waiting for client feedback.
- **Use Fridays for personal work**: If you're full-time, Fridays are a good time for personal projects, provided client work is in progress.
- **Delegate early to avoid issues later**: If something isn't clear, ask for clarity early. I'd rather spend time upfront than have to fix it later.
- **Tell people you are blocking**: "Hey Jason I am waiting on you to do X so I can delivery Y by this date, otherwise Z will happen".

## How to work with me effectively

- **Own your tasks and make decisions confidently**: Don't wait for my approval on every detail. I trust you to take action, even if mistakes happen. Just report back quickly if things go wrong. Again, assume if you mess up, it's Jason's fault. I didn't give you the right metric, or the right context, I didn't check in, or I didn't review clearly enough.
- **Give me consistent updates to reduce anxiety**: Silence creates stress. Even small updates help me stay aligned. Keep me in the loop regularly. If you get 1% off every day by the end of the week you might be completely off from where I need you to be.
- **Always challenge me with feedback**: Don't be afraid to tell me what's not working. I need feedback to grow, and I expect it.
- **Follow up with action items after every meeting**: After we meet, send a clear summary of next steps and anything that needs feedback.

## My approach to leadership

Remember, I'm a very new manager. Although I want to be very hands-off. If the team makes a mistake or executes poorly, I will shoulder that responsibility as an opportunity to learn how to be a better leader.

## What I need from others

I'm just constantly anxious and I don't know if I'm doing a good job. Telling me I'm doing a good job doesn't really help me; I just want to know the state of the business and how I can grow. I will grow, I just need to be watered.
