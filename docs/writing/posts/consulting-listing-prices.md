# A surprising reason to not list your consulting prices

A common question I get from the newsletter is whether or not I should lower my prices.

In this course, I'll explain why it might not be good to list your prices, whether you aim to communicate that you're affordable or exclusive.

In this article, we'll explore the pitfalls of transparent pricing, introduce more effective alternatives like minimum level of engagement pricing, and provide actionable strategies to maximize your value and earnings as a consultant.

## The Pitfalls of Transparent Pricing

When I first started consulting, I made the mistake of listing my rates. Here's why that's problematic:

1. **It limits your earning potential**: When a billion-dollar company reached out, they were getting the same price as a seed-stage startup. That's leaving money on the table.

2. **It can scare away potential clients**: Listing high prices to show exclusivity might deter clients who could benefit from your services but assume they can't afford you even when you can build a different offering, (monthly vs weekly meetings, meetings with vs without research memos, etc)

3. **It doesn't account for value**: Your pricing should reflect the value you bring, not just your time, even $11,000 per month started feeling too low.

## The Airline Pricing Model

As we've discussed in the [email course](https://indieconsulting.podia.com). Instead of fixed prices, think about pricing like an airline:

- Economy class: Your basic offering
- Business class: Enhanced service with more perks
- First class: Premium, high-touch service
- Private jet: Custom, enterprise-level solutions

This model allows you to cater to different client needs and budgets while maximizing your revenue.

## Value-Based Pricing: The Farmer Analogy

Consider a farmer who charges based on crop yield, not hours worked:

- If it rains more, they don't charge less because they didn't have to water the plants.
- If there's a drought, they don't charge extra for the time spent watering.

The focus is on the outcome (the harvest), not the input (time spent). This is the essence of value-based pricing. But there's probably some minimum yield that they care about. It's unlikely you're going to convince that farmer to tend to your roof garden.

## How to Talk About Pricing

Instead of listing fixed rates, provide estimates for minimum engagement:

"Our typical engagements start at $X over Y months. This ensures we have enough time and resources to deliver meaningful results."

## The Power of Discovery Calls

Use initial consultations to:

1. Understand the client's specific needs and challenges
2. Assess the potential value of your services to their business
3. Tailor your proposal and pricing to their situation

Remember, you're not just selling your time - you're selling outcomes and solutions.

The key takeaways:

1. Don't list your prices publicly to show affordability or exclusivity
2. Use a tiered pricing model like airlines
3. Focus on value-based pricing, not hourly rates
4. Provide minimum engagement estimates instead of fixed prices
5. Use discovery calls to tailor your pricing to each client

By adopting these strategies, you'll be able to price your services more effectively, attract the right clients, and maximize the value you provide (and receive) in your consulting work.
