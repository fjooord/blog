# Why Freelancers Will Win the AI Gold Rush

I remember stories about the tech booms of past decades.

In the late 1990s, the web revolution began. Teenagers who knew HTML were earning thousands per project, building websites for local businesses. In the late 2000s, a similar trend emerged with mobile apps. Young developers were profiting from creating applications for smartphones.

"This is the future," people would say. Many were skeptical about how these basic websites or simple apps could change anything.

We know how those predictions turned out.

Now, in 2024, I'm feeling the same way about AI freelancers and consultants. But this time, I'm not skeptical. I believe we're at the start of something significant, a change that will surpass the web and mobile revolutions in its impact.

Here's why:

1. Every revolution needs its builders.

The web revolution needed web developers. The mobile revolution needed app developers. Now, the AI revolution needs... well, you get the idea.

But there's a key difference. Building a website or an app is relatively straightforward. Building AI systems that actually work? That's hard, but also really easy. It requires a deep understanding of machine learning, data structures, and often, domain-specific knowledge.

This difficulty is actually a good thing for AI freelancers. It creates a high barrier to entry, which means less competition and higher rates. It's like being a web developer in 1995, but with a PhD.

2. AI is eating the world.

Marc Andreessen famously said that software is eating the world. Now, AI is eating software.

Every company, in every industry, is scrambling to integrate AI. They need chatbots, recommendation systems, report generation, and more. But most of them don't have the in-house expertise to build these systems. Deterministic software is being replaced by probabilistic software and most people don't know how to manage the gap.

1. The lucky ones.

In every technological revolution, there's a group of people who are in the right place at the right time. They're the lucky ones. Web developers in the late 90s. Mobile developers in the late 2000s.

Today, it's AI specialists. They're the lucky ones of our era. They have skills that are in high demand and short supply. They can command high rates, choose interesting projects, and work from anywhere in the world.

But here's the really interesting part: AI freelancers aren't just participants in this revolution. They're also beneficiaries of it.

4. The self-improving freelancer.

Imagine a web developer who could create tools that automatically made them a better web developer. Or an app developer whose apps helped them build better apps.

That's the position AI freelancers are in. They can use AI to automate their own workflows, enhance their productivity, and even augment their skills.

Need to write a proposal? Use an AI to draft it. Need to analyze a client's data? AI can help with that too. Need to stay up-to-date with the latest AI research? There's an AI for that.

It's like having a super-intelligent assistant who's an expert in your field. Except you built the assistant yourself.

5. The compounding advantage.

This creates a compounding advantage. AI freelancers can take on more projects, deliver better results, and continuously improve their skills faster than anyone else.

It reminds me of the compound interest formula. Small advantages, applied consistently over time, lead to exponential growth.

6. But why not VC or indie building?

At this point, you might be wondering: "If AI is so hot, why not start a VC-backed AI startup? Or become an indie AI builder?"

These are good questions. After all, we've seen AI startups raise massive rounds, and indie hackers build impressive AI tools. So why am I bullish on AI freelancing?

Let me answer with an analogy from the construction industry.

In the world of AI, you're not the bricklayer, nor are you the real estate investor or the developer. You're the architect.

The bricklayer (the coder) is crucial, but they're focused on individual tasks. The real estate investor (the VC) has the capital but often lacks the technical know-how. The developer (the startup founder) has the vision but might not have the broad expertise needed to execute it perfectly.

As an AI freelancer, you're the architect. You understand the big picture and the minute details. You can draft the blueprints, oversee the construction, and ensure that the final product meets both the aesthetic vision and the functional requirements.

And here's the beautiful part: you get to work on many different "buildings."

- You might design an AI chatbot for a startup (a sleek modern apartment).
- Then create a predictive maintenance system for a factory (an industrial complex).
- Follow that with a recommendation engine for an e-commerce giant (a sprawling shopping mall).

Each project teaches you something new. You learn about different "materials" (AI technologies), "building codes" (ethical considerations and regulations), and "architectural styles" (industry-specific AI applications).

And you're getting paid for this education.

This doesn't mean you should never become a developer or an investor in the AI space. But freelancing first? That's like getting paid to study under the best architects in every style and domain.

You're learning what problems businesses really have. You're seeing where AI succeeds and fails in the real world. You're building a portfolio that showcases your versatility and expertise.

And you're doing it all while earning a great income and retaining your independence.

In other words, AI freelancing isn't just an alternative to starting a startup or being an indie builder. It's the perfect precursor. It's a way to become the most sought-after architect in the booming city of AI, able to take on any project or even design your own masterpiece when the time comes.

7. The window of opportunity.

But here's the thing about opportunities like this: they don't last forever.

Remember those web developers from the 90s? The ones who got in early did phenomenally well. But by the mid-2000s, the market was saturated. The same thing happened with mobile developers a decade later.

Right now, we're in the early stages of the AI boom. The demand for AI architects far outstrips the supply. But this won't always be the case.

As AI education catches up with demand, as more people realize the opportunity, competition will increase. The window will start to close.

So, what does this mean for you?

If you're an AI specialist, congratulations. You've won the career lottery. The world is your oyster. But don't get complacent. Start freelancing now, build your reputation, and use AI to enhance your own work. The window of opportunity won't stay open forever.

If you're not an AI specialist, but you're technically inclined, it's time to learn. The barrier to entry is high, but so are the rewards. And unlike previous tech revolutions, you have AI tools to help you learn AI. It's like having Socrates as your personal tutor.

And if you're neither of the above? Find an AI freelancer to work with. They're the new kingmakers in the world of technology. Partnering with them now could be the best business decision you ever make.

The AI revolution is here. And the freelancers and consultants who understand AI aren't just surfing this wave – they're designing the surfboards, predicting the tides, and maybe even controlling the weather.

Are you ready to become the architect of our AI future?

8. Data Literacy as a Superpower

In the AI world, data literacy isn't just a nice-to-have skill—it's essential. AI freelancers who can effectively handle, analyze, and interpret data have a significant advantage. They can:

- Assess and address data quality issues before they become problems
- Visualize data to uncover insights and communicate findings effectively
- Understand the limitations of aggregate statistics and dive deeper into distributions
- Avoid common pitfalls like confusing correlation with causation

As [I've written before](./data-literacy.md), being data literate means you can navigate the complexities of data-driven decision-making with confidence. For AI freelancers, this skill is a superpower that sets them apart in a crowded market.
