# My AI Journey

Every journey has its roots, and mine begins with an unconventional childhood that laid the foundation for my future in technology and AI.

## Early Years: A Foundation in Building

I was fortunate to have an unusual childhood that shaped my approach to technology. My father, an early AOL employee who retired at 35 after the company's IPO, spent countless hours with me during my formative years. Together, we explored hands-on skills like carpentry, metalworking, and automotive repair. While this might seem disconnected from my current work in AI, these early experiences instilled in me a fundamental love for building and problem-solving.

Despite growing up during the digital revolution, my coding experience was limited. Our Mac-only household made it challenging to explore my initial interest in Xbox game modding. My first real introduction to programming came through high school robotics club, where I primarily focused on mechanical engineering—a natural extension of my hands-on background.

## Finding My Path at Georgia Tech

### The Mathematical Detour
I entered Georgia Tech as a mathematics major, drawn by my natural aptitude for numbers. However, the career prospects—primarily in research or actuarial science—left me uninspired. A pivotal moment came when I scored an impressive 2/100 on an abstract algebra test, prompting an immediate reevaluation of my academic direction.

### The Switch to Computer Science
While initially considering industrial engineering, I discovered something unexpected: I was consistently excelling in my computer science classes while merely getting by in industrial engineering. This realization led me to pursue a computer science degree with specializations in intelligence and modeling/simulations.

### Graduate Studies: A Creative Awakening
The COVID-19 pandemic coincided with a significant turning point in my academic journey. Through my position as a research assistant at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, I had the opportunity to pursue a master's degree with covered tuition and living expenses. I chose to focus on computer graphics, complementing my machine learning coursework with more creative, hands-on applications.

This decision proved transformative. Classes in computational aesthetics, video game design, and shape grammars revealed a side of computer science I hadn't seen before—one where technical expertise met creative expression. For the first time, I found myself going far beyond assignment requirements, driven by genuine passion rather than obligation.

## The Professional Pivot to AI

### ChatGPT: A Catalyst for Change
As I was completing my studies, ChatGPT emerged and captured the world's attention. Having previously experimented with GPT-2 fine-tuning in my coursework, I recognized the revolutionary potential of this technology. After graduation, I dedicated myself entirely to exploring and building with LLMs, foregoing other pursuits to immerse myself in the field.

### Professional Evolution
My career in AI has been deliberately varied, each role chosen to build specific expertise:

1. **Width AI** - My entry into professional AI development, where I built an agent building platform and expanded my skills into TypeScript and frontend development. I also took on various projects through Width including developing custom LLM applications, building RAG systems, and creating AI-powered automation tools for clients.

2. **Morningside AI** - Here, I deepened my understanding of product development and software engineering under experienced mentorship, contributing to their Agentive SaaS platform.

3. **VRSEN AI** - As a technical project manager, I led multi-agent development projects while gaining crucial experience in client relations, project scoping, and technical consulting.

## Present and Future

Now based in Austin, Texas, I've established my own bespoke AI development agency and consultancy. This venture represents the culmination of my journey—combining technical expertise, creative problem-solving, and a deep understanding of client needs in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

My path has been anything but linear, yet each experience—from childhood tinkering to academic exploration to professional development—has contributed to my unique perspective on AI development and consulting. I'm excited to continue pushing boundaries and helping clients harness the transformative power of AI technology.
