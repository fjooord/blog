# My AI Journey

I don't mean to sound cliche but this all starts back when I was growing up and a lot of how I was raised has led me down the path that I have chosen. 

# Growing up
My childhood was a pretty great one and something I think that is not super common.

My dad worked for AOL pre IPO and this then allowed him after the IPO and he exited his options to be able to retire at around 35.  This then allowed for him to spend a lot of time with me and I grew up building tinkering and Learning a lot mainly about how to do things with my hands such as carpentry metalworking and working on cars and stuff.

I didn't really have much experience in coding in during this time as I wasn't really interested in writing code or writing apps.  The only thing coding-wise that I really did in the growing up time was you working on modding Xbox games which was really hard for me to do as we didn't have any Windows computers and we only had Macs. 

My first real experience though writing code and such was through my high school classes where I was able to be part of the robotics club and able to take a class of very basic coding.

For robotics, I didn't really do much coding. I knew something about the code, but most of what I did was more on the mechanical engineering side of things of building the robot and stuff as that was what I was most skilled with from the aforementioned things I did growing up. The class mission didn't really have a huge amount of coding that was done. We met did a little like HTML coding and stuff but no real in-depth coding was done.

and with that is where my coding stopped until I got to college. I didn't know what I wanted to do going into college. I was very good at math and other sciences. This led me to look for colleges that were good technical schools and I didn't really want to go that far from home and I didn't want to go to somewhere colder than Virginia so I looked south and I was able to get Georgia Tech and that's where I went. 

# College
## Undergraduate
i came into college as a math major was not my best decision i didn't like math that much and the career paths that math was shown to me didn't really suit what i was looking to do.  All of the career fairs and such that I went to in college were pretty much like yeah you could be a researcher or an actuary which I was like this sounds like hell I don't want to do this.  I was a math major until my second year of college when I got my best grade on a test ever of a two out of 100 on an abstract algebra test and right after that I promptly went to student portal and proceeded to change my major. 

I originally was trying to switch to industrial engineering but this didn't end up happening as when I was taking the classes to be able to transition into industrial engineering all of the computer science classes I was taking I had hundreds in and was doing very well and the industrial engineering classes I was not liking and was passing but was not enthralled with it 

given this i transitioned into a computer science degree with specializations in intelligence and modeling and simulations. 

I did my classes in college and undergrad I got everything done but I wasn't hugely in love with it as I was still trying to figure out what I would want to do with this in the future 
To really emphasize I was not a good student in my undergrad I would be getting projects done at the last minute barely studying and just essentially surviving college instead of really putting my best foot forward.

Through my classes and some of the research projects I had done I was able to get a position at the Georgia Tech Research Institute as a research assistant.  I would end up working here doing a bunch of various research methodology on primarily missile detection systems for helicopters and other aviation uses for the military and Department of Defense, and AirForce.

Again, this was something I didn't really love but I needed a job and this was getting me some experience and it was just something that I could do I was still figuring out what I wanted to do.

## Graduate School
During my time at college the covid 19 pandemic happened. 
213
I was sent home and was again not super loving the courses I was taking. 
This as an aside but I generally do not think computer science is taught in a way that gets people excited about it as it doesn't teach you how to actually build things in the real world.  This is largely due to I believe that professors most of which have spent their whole life in academia don't really know how to do real world so it's not their fault but it is something to consider.

A perk of the research assistant position I have is if you decide to do a master's degree they will cover your tuition and you get a stipend to pay for housing and such so it's essentially very very cheap college to do your master's degree.

I was offered this route and I decided to go with it. I ended up doing my master's in computer graphics as I was doing a bunch of research in to the field of machine learning and I had some more machine learning courses that I was taking my master's program but I wanted my masters to be more interesting and doing something that I was a little more hands-on and I actually got to see what I got to create.

This ended up being I think one of the best decisions of my life. 
It gave me a new perspective on computer science as before doing some of these classes that I was able to take in my grad school I thought of computer sciences more as not fun and a job more versus something that I could actually get my hands dirty with and build fun things. 

Some of these classes Google or computational aesthetics video game design and shape grammars each of which brought their own special flavor of how to actually build beautiful things with computers.

It really brought something out of me that I hadn't seen in a very long time where I would spend hours beyond what I needed to just complete projects but I would go above and beyond to really make things the best that I could. to really make things that I am proud of which honestly I hadn't done for any of the other projects in school 

## Leaving School
I didn't really have a real plan for when I was leaving school 

Part of the jobs I was looking at was doing game design and technical animation as those were some things I really enjoyed during school. 
I felt though that this was kind of a waste as I really wanted to do more with AI and while I did like animation and such it didn't feel like the thing that I was meant to do. 

And the stars kind of aligned with this as I was graduating is when ChatGPT really came on the scene and started to take over some of the news cycles and become very popular. 
I had done a little bit of work with fine tuning GPT-2 in some classes in college but didn't really dive super deep into working with it. 
After I graduated I had a few months left on my lease in Atlanta and every day I would just start messing around and building with chat GPT. 

# Going Home (March 2023)
my lease ended and I didn't have a job in Atlanta yet as I really hadn't applied much to any.

This being said I had to go home and my original plan was to look for a job in Atlanta from home.

This isn't exactly what happened though. 

I instead Put any distraction I could have possibly had away video games playing golf Pretty much forgo all hobbies and just spent every day working and building with various LLMs and learning how to actually set up APIs and deploy things and make real applications.

I was joining discord communities watching every YouTube video I could get my hands on reading books doing anything and everything to learn about LLMs and this technology as I'd gotten obsessed with it. 

I did some cool experiments such as synthetic polling, built some microsasses that obviously flopped. Was joining these communities and was trying to network and learn as much as I could. 

through these communities I was able to land my first gig through an agency doing large language model development which takes us to my career point. 

# Starting my Career (August 2023)
## Width AI (Intellibridge)
through Discord I responded to a job offering which then directed me to an interview through Twitter where I was able to get my first job as a AI Developer through an agency 

It was a contract job for a company called Intellibridge where I was building an agent building platform based off of FlowWise which is an open source drag and drop LLM agent builder. 

This is a good experience as it shifted my knowledge from mainly python at this point to doing a lot of stuff with javascript and it put me into doing some more front-end oriented things with learning how to build with typescript. 

This opportunity got a little stale though as it by the end of the contract it had shifted away from doing AI builds and more just general software development which was not what i was trying to do.

## Transition my Mindset
at this point i knew i didn't know as much as i needed to know.  My goal then shifted to be to work at a variety of different agencies and such that I saw and I thought were doing interesting work so that I could learn how to do this AI stuff better than just the hobbyist builds I was doing. 

With this in mind I started looking for jobs that had possibly a lower pay but at places that were smaller where I could really get some hands on build time and then I could learn from people that were better than me. 

## Morningside AI (October 2023)
Through one of the communities I was part of there was another job offering for an AI developer at a place called Morningside. They have a large YouTube channel and they specialize in AI automations 

I was able to get this job where I was able to learn from their CTO Spencer and learned a huge amount of general software engineering and actually scoping and building a product 

Here I did a little bit of client work building some things out for them and also as part of building their initial MVP for the SAS product they offer Agentive. 

Eventually though this shifted to more of maintaining the code instead of learning more and more about AI so we decided to part ways.

## Back to Width

In the interim here I continued working with AI to work on various projects 

## VRSEN AI (March 2024)
Agent and Multi-agent Development was starting to become extraordinarily popular.
Due to this I looked for jobs in multi-agent development and found a job as a technical project manager at Vercen AI, a smaller agency that specializes in multi-agent development through the use of their open source framework agency swarm 

Here I was able to work with a large variety of clients and build a lot of different and interesting solutions utilizing various forms of AI technology and multi-agent communication.

what I learned here also was how to interface with clients how to really get some hands-on experience scoping and building out projects from start to finish as I was while doing the technical project management I was doing lead development on projects doing sales calls interacting with clients regularly so I was fulfilling the role of a technical consultant project manager client success sales I was a very good experience for building out a full repertoire of skills that I would need to be able to do this work. 

## Leaving VRSEN AI
Leaving Versen was a tough decision for me as I really liked people there but the technical project manager role was focused more on the actual project management side of things rather than the AI development which the development side is really my passion 

# Moving to Austin (September 2024)
I've now moved down to Austin, Texas with my girlfriend and I'm working on setting up my own agency 
I've realized that I don't think right now in my life I can really, or I don't really want to work for somebody else. I'd rather work for myself

For this being said I have now shifted fully to running my own business of a bespoke development agency / consultancy and am excited to work with whoever has read this far. 

# Conclusion
I've learned so much over the past year and a half and have gained a lot of confidence in building this and i'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
