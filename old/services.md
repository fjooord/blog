# Services

## Strategy
I will advise you on:

- LLM performance issues: (cost, quality, speed)
- Evals, RAG, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering

I will provide your team with ongoing guidance through regular meetings.

## Implementation
I also offer hands-on services:

**Implementation**: I will write production-ready code to accelerate your AI product development.

**Model Optimization**: I will implement domain-specific eval systems, fine-tune, prompt engineer and debug models to improve performance.

**Tools and Infrastructure**: I will build tools that enable you to execute consistently and quickly.

**Pricing**: My minimum level of engagement for hands-on services typically starts at **$15,000**. I customize my pricing based on expected outcomes.


If you're an engineering leader at a startup looking to systematically improve your AI product, I'd love to help. My experience includes:

- Building production-ready custom LLM applications and RAG systems
- Training engineering teams on AI development best practices and implementation
- Leading multi-agent development projects and technical consulting engagements
- Developing AI-powered automation tools and agent building platforms

With experience across multiple AI consultancies and hands-on development roles, I can guide your team through the challenges of AI product development - from initial scoping to production deployment - while ensuring your team is well-equipped to succeed in this rapidly evolving field.



## My background is not like many others

My journey to AI consulting has been unique. Starting with a foundation in hands-on building and problem-solving, I evolved through mathematics at Georgia Tech into computer science with specializations in intelligence and modeling. During graduate studies, I combined machine learning with creative applications in computer graphics.

When ChatGPT emerged, I recognized its revolutionary potential from my previous work with GPT-2. I've since gained diverse experience across multiple roles:

- Built agent platforms and RAG systems at Width AI
- Developed agent-based SaaS products at Morningside AI
- Led multi-agent projects and technical consulting at VRSEN AI

Sound familiar to your challenges?

- *How do we turn AI capabilities into real products?*
- *How do we implement effective search and retrieval?*
- *How do we measure and improve system performance?*
- *How do we build systems that learn from user feedback?*
- *How do we prioritize AI initiatives for business impact?*

I'm not focused on theoretical research or chasing the latest models. Instead, I guide teams toward practical solutions:

- Start with simple, effective baselines
- Build maintainable systems
- Focus on measurable business outcomes

These principles ensure that your AI initiatives remain grounded in real-world applications and deliver tangible results.

And over the past few years I've worked with a dozen companies to help them navigate the landscape. **I know what works and what doesn't.** For everything else, I have a network of trusted experts and vendors to help us.

## An investment in regret minimization

I've seen companies waste months and millions.

I can't promise you'll succeed or find product-market fit if you work together, but I can promise that I can help you make a clear plan, push your team to keep trying simple experiments, and focus on what really matters.

My job is simple: to tell you when what you think is easy is actually hard, and when what you think is hard is actually easy.

Success is about minimizing regret.

## How best to work with me

There are three ways to work with me:

1. **Subscription model**: Includes a 45-minute meeting each week, unlimited email/slack access, and my network of experts. I'll pay to help you with them.

2. **Project-based engagement**: We will tackle a specific initiative with a fixed scope and budget. This includes helping you write content, do research, and anything else you need.

3. **Traditional consulting relationship**: We meet every week to discuss strategy, planning, and execution. I may bring in extra staff.

I don't work on hourly rates, and my work is guaranteed. With the work that we're doing together, **I'm always happy to refund any fees.**

### Minimum Level of Engagement

If these are too much, I suggest reading my [blog](./writing/index.md) or check out my [course on improving RAG systems](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md) which is a fraction of the cost.

- **Async Support**: $9,500 per month, 45 minute weekly syncs and unlimited email/slack access.
- **Strategic Consulting**: Starts at $50k for the entire engagement
- **Comprehensive Consulting**: Starts at $120k for the entire engagement

For services beyond async support, I ask for at least a 3-month commitment. You can pay through Stripe, and my assistant will contact you after. Or, you can fill out our form, and we'll reach out to you.
